django-coffeemachine
====================

This is for people who prefer to have coffeescript files compiled
locally (not on the production server).

Run:

./manage.py makecoffee

to compile your coffeescript files. You will need to set
COFFEEMACHINE_INPUT and COFFEEMACHINE_OUTPUT vars in your settings.

This is a very simple command, just look at the source for details.
